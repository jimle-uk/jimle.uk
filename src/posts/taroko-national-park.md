Taken at the [Taroko national park in Hualien county, Taiwan](https://goo.gl/maps/fbQsEP7znP62).

After a gruelling 5 hour journey along the east coast from Taipei to Hualien county,
we make a short detour to the Taroko national park to spend what daylight hours we had left.
Unfortunately, we arrive at a bad time and though we couldn't get in, this shot in the
carpark is easily one of my top favourites from the entire trip.
